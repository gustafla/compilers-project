- [ ] Errors with location
  - [X] Create appropriate struct and Error implementation

  - [X] Make assembly generator emit code for multiple functions
    - [X] Labels in functions must be unique within the module
  - [X] Implement function parsing
  - [X] Add user-defined functions in symbol tables
    - [X] In the interpreter, map each user-defined function to a Python function that runs the interpreter on the user-defined functionâ€™s body
    - [X] In the type-checker, map each user-defined function to a function type based on the type annotations
    - [X] In the IR and Assembly generators, do the same as with built-in functions
  - [X] Make incoming parameters available as variables in all stages that use a symbol table
    - [X] Interpreter

    - [X] Assembly
  - [X] Change the type-checker, IR generator and Assembly generator to process function definitions in addition to the top-level expression
  - [X] Implement return ... expressions in all compiler stages
    - [X] A function whose return type is not Unit must execute a return expression.
    - [X] Test Gadget does have cases where the only return occurs within a while true loop
